Build a simple binary tree data structure with the following methods:

1. build_tree(array) - Takes an array of data and turns it into a binary tree
2. insert(value) - Take a value and inserts into the binary tree
3. delete(value) - Deletes the value if found in  the binary tree
4. breadth_first_search(target) - Takes a target value and returns the node at which it is located using breadth first search technique
5. depth_first_search(target) - Returns node at which target value is located using the depth first search technique
