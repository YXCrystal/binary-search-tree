Build a simple binary tree data structure with the following methods:

1. build_tree(array) - Takes an array of data and turns it into a binary tree
2. breadth_first_search(value) - Takes a target value and returns the node at which it is located using breadth first search technique
3. depth_first_search(value) - Returns node at which target value is located using the depth first search technique
4. dfs_rec - Recursive method that runs a depth first search

Project Purpose: Binary Search Tree Implementation in Ruby
